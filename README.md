# Travel planning (Backend)

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

An API (Application Programming Interface) for a travel planning application that uses Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, and Sequelize. The motivation for building this API was to improve my backend web developer skills and better familiarize myself with API routes, models, and MySQL schemas. I built this project to demonstrate how the previously listed tools work together with the example of planning a trip as a traveler. The problems I solved with this API are creating the backend for an potential fullstack application that helps travelers plan trips to destinations of there choosing. What I learned from this project was a better understanding of how the models and api routes work together to provide the user information retrieved by the routes from the database.
